(how do we find a transition matrix/ matrix of transition probabilities in real world? Give an example)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

In the context of Markov chains and stochastic processes, a transition matrix, also known as a matrix of transition probabilities, is a square matrix that represents the probabilities of moving from one state to another within a finite set of states. These matrices are widely used in various fields, including finance, biology, computer science, and more.

To find a transition matrix in the real world, you typically need to gather data from observations or experiments, where the system you are interested in exhibits some form of probabilistic behavior.

Let's take a simple example of a weather system with three states: Sunny (S), Cloudy (C), and Rainy (R). We want to find the transition matrix based on historical data of how the weather changes from day to day.

Example:

Suppose we have the following historical data:

1. Out of 100 sunny days, 80 were followed by another sunny day, 10 by a cloudy day, and 10 by a rainy day.
2. Out of 100 cloudy days, 30 were followed by a sunny day, 40 by another cloudy day, and 30 by a rainy day.
3. Out of 100 rainy days, 50 were followed by a sunny day, 20 by a cloudy day, and 30 by another rainy day.

Now, we can construct the transition matrix based on these probabilities:

The transition matrix T is a 3x3 matrix where T[i, j] represents the probability of transitioning from state i to state j.

T = | T[SS] T[SC] T[SR] |
    | T[CS] T[CC] T[CR] |
    | T[RS] T[RC] T[RR] |

Where:
T[SS] = Probability of transitioning from Sunny to Sunny = 80/100 = 0.8
T[SC] = Probability of transitioning from Sunny to Cloudy = 10/100 = 0.1
T[SR] = Probability of transitioning from Sunny to Rainy = 10/100 = 0.1

T[CS] = Probability of transitioning from Cloudy to Sunny = 30/100 = 0.3
T[CC] = Probability of transitioning from Cloudy to Cloudy = 40/100 = 0.4
T[CR] = Probability of transitioning from Cloudy to Rainy = 30/100 = 0.3

T[RS] = Probability of transitioning from Rainy to Sunny = 50/100 = 0.5
T[RC] = Probability of transitioning from Rainy to Cloudy = 20/100 = 0.2
T[RR] = Probability of transitioning from Rainy to Rainy = 30/100 = 0.3

Note that each row of the matrix sums to 1, as the probabilities of transitioning from a state to all other states should add up to 1.

In this example, the transition matrix T represents the probabilities of how the weather changes from day to day based on historical data. You can use this matrix to analyze the long-term behavior of the weather system and make predictions about future weather patterns.

>>>> I ASKED:
(So this is a matrix for 100 days of each kind of weather? Can we do 200 days, 300 days  and so on? 
What do the metereological department use? Do they use Markov chains or some other method?)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

Yes, the example transition matrix I provided was based on data for 100 days of each kind of weather. You can certainly use more days of data to construct a transition matrix for 200 days, 300 days, and beyond, as long as you have enough historical data to estimate the transition probabilities accurately.

In real-world applications, meteorological departments and weather forecasting agencies use sophisticated techniques that often go beyond simple Markov chains. While Markov chains can provide some insights into short-term weather patterns and transitions between weather states, weather prediction involves a wide range of complex factors, including atmospheric dynamics, physical processes, climate models, numerical weather prediction, and more.

Modern meteorological departments use numerical weather prediction models, which are based on the fundamental equations of atmospheric physics and dynamics. These models divide the atmosphere into a three-dimensional grid and solve equations that govern the motion of air, moisture, temperature, and pressure to predict the evolution of weather systems over time.

These numerical models assimilate vast amounts of observational data from various sources, such as satellites, weather stations, radar, weather balloons, and aircraft, to initialize the model and improve the accuracy of predictions. The models also account for various physical processes, such as radiation, convection, advection, and precipitation, to provide detailed forecasts for various weather variables like temperature, wind, humidity, and precipitation.

Numerical weather prediction has proven to be much more accurate and reliable for medium to long-range weather forecasting compared to simple Markov chains or other statistical methods. It allows meteorologists to make forecasts several days ahead and helps in understanding complex weather phenomena like hurricanes, cyclones, and large-scale weather patterns.

While Markov chains and other statistical methods can be useful for certain aspects of weather analysis, they are often incorporated into larger numerical weather prediction systems to enhance the overall forecasting capabilities. The combination of advanced numerical models and data assimilation techniques has significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts in the modern era.

>>>> I ASKED:
(So what is a Markov model? How does it use Markov chain? give example)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

A Markov model is a type of stochastic model that follows the principles of Markov chains. It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov and is widely used in various fields, including statistics, engineering, economics, biology, and more. A Markov model is particularly useful for situations where the future state of a system depends only on its current state, and the system exhibits a property known as the Markov property or memorylessness.

In a Markov model, the system is represented as a set of states, and transitions between states occur probabilistically. The probabilities of moving from one state to another are determined by transition probabilities, and these probabilities are often arranged in the form of a transition matrix.

Here's how a Markov chain is used in a simple example of a weather model:

Suppose we have three weather states: Sunny (S), Cloudy (C), and Rainy (R). We want to predict the weather on a given day based on the weather of the previous day. We assume that the weather has a memoryless property, meaning that the probability of tomorrow's weather depends only on today's weather, not on any previous days.

We can represent the transition probabilities between states using a transition matrix. Let's assume the following transition probabilities based on historical data:

T = | T[SS] T[SC] T[SR] |
    | T[CS] T[CC] T[CR] |
    | T[RS] T[RC] T[RR] |

Where:
T[SS] = Probability of transitioning from Sunny to Sunny
T[SC] = Probability of transitioning from Sunny to Cloudy
T[SR] = Probability of transitioning from Sunny to Rainy
T[CS] = Probability of transitioning from Cloudy to Sunny
T[CC] = Probability of transitioning from Cloudy to Cloudy
T[CR] = Probability of transitioning from Cloudy to Rainy
T[RS] = Probability of transitioning from Rainy to Sunny
T[RC] = Probability of transitioning from Rainy to Cloudy
T[RR] = Probability of transitioning from Rainy to Rainy

For example, based on historical data, we may find that:
T[SS] = 0.7 (70% chance of staying Sunny if it is currently Sunny)
T[SC] = 0.2 (20% chance of transitioning from Sunny to Cloudy)
T[SR] = 0.1 (10% chance of transitioning from Sunny to Rainy)
T[CS] = 0.3 (30% chance of transitioning from Cloudy to Sunny)
T[CC] = 0.6 (60% chance of staying Cloudy if it is currently Cloudy)
T[CR] = 0.1 (10% chance of transitioning from Cloudy to Rainy)
T[RS] = 0.4 (40% chance of transitioning from Rainy to Sunny)
T[RC] = 0.3 (30% chance of transitioning from Rainy to Cloudy)
T[RR] = 0.3 (30% chance of staying Rainy if it is currently Rainy)

With this transition matrix, we can predict the weather for multiple days ahead by repeatedly applying the transition probabilities. For example, if today is Sunny, we can use the matrix to calculate the probabilities of the weather being Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy tomorrow. We can then use the same process to predict the weather for the day after tomorrow and so on.

Markov models are useful in various applications, including finance (e.g., stock price modeling), natural language processing, and machine learning (e.g., Hidden Markov Models for speech recognition). They provide a simple yet powerful way to model systems with random transitions between states, making them valuable tools for probabilistic forecasting and decision-making.









------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>> I ASKED:
(Can you give a real world example of Markov models used in Decision making?)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

Certainly! One real-world example of Markov models used in decision-making is in the field of healthcare, specifically in modeling disease progression and treatment decisions.

Example: Markov Model for Cancer Treatment Decision

Consider a scenario where a patient has been diagnosed with an early-stage cancer. The patient's treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Each treatment has associated costs, potential side effects, and probabilities of disease progression or remission. The decision-making process involves finding the optimal treatment strategy that maximizes the patient's quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or minimizes costs over time.

A Markov model can be used to represent this decision problem. The states in the model represent the different health states that the patient can be in, such as "Well," "Cancer Recurrence," or "Post-Treatment Side Effects." The transitions between states are determined by probabilities associated with disease progression, treatment effectiveness, and possible adverse events.

The transition probabilities in the Markov model might be estimated based on clinical data, medical literature, or expert opinions. For example:

- The probability of cancer recurrence after surgery might be based on historical data for similar patients.
- The probability of experiencing certain side effects after chemotherapy might be estimated from clinical trials.
- The probability of transitioning from "Well" to "Cancer Recurrence" might depend on the stage of cancer and the specific treatment chosen.

Once the Markov model is constructed, various decision analysis techniques can be applied to find the optimal treatment strategy. For example, decision tree analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, or Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can be used to explore different treatment sequences and evaluate their long-term outcomes, considering the uncertainties in the model.

By applying the Markov model in this decision-making process, healthcare professionals can gain insights into the expected outcomes and trade-offs of different treatment options. This helps in making informed decisions that optimize patient outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare resource allocation.

Markov models in decision-making are not limited to healthcare. They are also used in fields like finance (e.g., modeling stock prices and investment decisions), operations research (e.g., inventory management and queuing systems), and marketing (e.g., customer behavior modeling and product adoption).

Overall, Markov models provide a powerful framework for analyzing decision problems with uncertain outcomes and are widely applied in various real-world scenarios to aid decision-making processes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>> I ASKED:
(Can you construct a model based on dummy data and possibly use one of the methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo or Decision tree analysis? )

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:
Sure, let's create a simple example of a Markov model for a decision-making problem using dummy data and then apply a Decision Tree analysis to find an optimal treatment strategy.

Example: Markov Model for Cancer Treatment Decision

Let's consider a hypothetical scenario of a patient diagnosed with early-stage cancer. The patient has three treatment options: Surgery (S), Chemotherapy (C), and Radiation Therapy (R). We will use a simplified Markov model with two health states: "Well" and "Cancer Recurrence." The patient can be in either of these two states at any given time.

We will assume the following transition probabilities for the Markov model:
- Probability of cancer recurrence after Surgery (S): 0.3
- Probability of cancer recurrence after Chemotherapy (C): 0.6
- Probability of cancer recurrence after Radiation Therapy (R): 0.5

Let's create a Decision Tree analysis to find the optimal treatment strategy:

```plaintext
Decision Tree Analysis:

                 Well
                /   \
               /     \
        Surgery (S) Chemotherapy (C)
          /            \
         /              \
   Recurrence (R)  Recurrence (R)
```

In this Decision Tree, the patient starts in the "Well" state. At the first decision node, the patient can either undergo Surgery (S) or Chemotherapy (C). After each treatment, there is a chance of cancer recurrence, leading to the "Recurrence" state. The probabilities of recurrence are taken from the Markov model.

To find the optimal treatment strategy, we can compute the expected QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) for each path in the Decision Tree and choose the treatment option that maximizes the expected QALYs.

Assuming the QALY values for each state are:
- Well: 1 QALY
- Recurrence: 0 QALY (a value of 0 is assigned as the patient's quality of life is lower during cancer recurrence)

Let's compute the expected QALYs for each path in the Decision Tree:

1. Surgery (S):
   - Probability of recurrence (R): 0.3
   - Expected QALYs = (1 - 0.3) * 1 = 0.7 QALYs

2. Chemotherapy (C):
   - Probability of recurrence (R): 0.6
   - Expected QALYs = (1 - 0.6) * 1 = 0.4 QALYs

Based on the expected QALYs, the optimal treatment strategy would be Surgery (S) as it provides the highest expected QALYs.

In this simplified example, we used a Decision Tree analysis to find the optimal treatment strategy based on dummy data and a simple Markov model. In real-world scenarios, more complex Markov models and decision analysis techniques would be used, taking into account additional factors like costs, side effects, and patient preferences to make informed and personalized treatment decisions.







------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>> I ASKED:
(can we create a Decision Tree machine learning model for the Decision Tree analysis. Can it be used for this purpose?)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

Yes, you can create a Decision Tree machine learning model to perform Decision Tree analysis for decision-making purposes, including the cancer treatment decision problem described earlier. Decision Trees are a popular supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.

In the context of decision-making, you can use a Decision Tree machine learning model to learn from historical data and automatically find the optimal treatment strategy based on the input features and associated outcomes. The model can identify patterns and relationships in the data to determine which treatment options are more likely to lead to favorable outcomes (e.g., higher QALYs or lower recurrence rates).

To use a Decision Tree machine learning model for the cancer treatment decision problem, you would need a dataset that includes information about patients, the treatments they received, and the outcomes (e.g., whether they experienced cancer recurrence and their corresponding QALY values). The dataset should also include features that are relevant for the treatment decision, such as patient demographics, cancer stage, and other relevant medical information.

The steps to use a Decision Tree machine learning model for decision-making are as follows:

1. Data Preparation: Preprocess and prepare the dataset, ensuring that it is properly cleaned, and features are appropriately encoded or scaled.

2. Data Split: Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the Decision Tree model, and the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

3. Model Training: Use the training set to train the Decision Tree model on the features and outcomes. The model will learn the decision rules and patterns from the data.

4. Model Evaluation: Use the test set to evaluate the model's performance. You can use various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, depending on the specific objectives of the decision-making problem.

5. Decision Making: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict the optimal treatment strategy for new patients based on their input features. The model will provide predictions, and you can choose the treatment option that maximizes the desired outcome.

Keep in mind that in real-world healthcare applications, ethical considerations and additional factors (e.g., patient preferences, treatment costs, and potential side effects) play crucial roles in the decision-making process. Therefore, machine learning models should be used as decision support tools, and the final treatment decisions should be made by healthcare professionals in consultation with the patients.

Overall, Decision Tree machine learning models can be powerful tools for decision-making, as they can automatically discover complex decision patterns from data and assist in choosing the most suitable treatment strategies based on patient characteristics and outcomes.

>>>> I ASKED:
(Can you give five rows of dummy data for my reference?)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

Certainly! Here are five rows of dummy data for the cancer treatment decision problem:

Assuming the columns are: "Patient_ID", "Treatment", "Cancer_Recurrence", and "QALY":

1. Patient_ID: 1, Treatment: Surgery, Cancer_Recurrence: No, QALY: 1.0
2. Patient_ID: 2, Treatment: Chemotherapy, Cancer_Recurrence: Yes, QALY: 0.6
3. Patient_ID: 3, Treatment: Radiation Therapy, Cancer_Recurrence: No, QALY: 1.0
4. Patient_ID: 4, Treatment: Surgery, Cancer_Recurrence: No, QALY: 1.0
5. Patient_ID: 5, Treatment: Chemotherapy, Cancer_Recurrence: Yes, QALY: 0.4

Please note that this data is purely hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. In a real-world scenario, you would have a much larger dataset with a diverse set of patients, treatment options, and associated outcomes. Additionally, you would include more relevant features and information to make the decision-making process more accurate and meaningful.

>>>> I ASKED:
(So in this dataset the target is QALY? or maximizing QALY? Should I use Decision Tree Regressor? This is for learning purpose and I understood that the ML model is used to aid decision making process.)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

In this dataset, the target variable is QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Years). Since QALY is a continuous variable representing the quality of life, this becomes a regression problem, and you should use a regression model to predict the QALY values.

For this learning purpose and to aid the decision-making process, you can use a Decision Tree Regressor. The Decision Tree Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that builds a decision tree to predict continuous numeric values, such as QALY in this case.

Here's how you can proceed:

1. Prepare the Data: Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed. Split the data into features (input variables) and the target variable (QALY).

2. Split the Data: Divide the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the Decision Tree Regressor, and the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

3. Model Training: Train the Decision Tree Regressor using the training data. The model will learn to make predictions based on the input features.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the test data. You can use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess how well the model predicts QALY values.

5. Decision Making: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict QALY values for new patients based on their input features. The model's predictions can assist in decision-making by providing an estimate of the expected QALY value for each treatment option.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and in real-world scenarios, the dataset would be more extensive and complex, and you would consider other factors in the decision-making process, such as treatment costs, patient preferences, and potential side effects.

Using machine learning models, such as Decision Tree Regressors, can aid in decision-making by providing quantitative insights and predictions based on historical data. However, the final decision should still be made by healthcare professionals in consultation with the patients, taking into account various ethical, medical, and patient-specific considerations.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>> I ASKED:
(So, Markov models are used to predict whether the patient after undergoing certain treatments will come out with some QALYs. What if there are several treatments the patient has to undergo to determine the final QALY and there are QALYs after each treatments.)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

If there are multiple treatments that a patient has to undergo, and each treatment can have an impact on the patient's QALY, you can still use a Markov model to model the patient's progression through different treatment states and calculate the overall expected QALY.

To handle this scenario, you can extend the Markov model to include multiple health states that represent the patient's status at different stages of treatment. Each health state can be associated with a specific treatment option and its corresponding QALY value. The transitions between these health states will be determined by the probabilities of treatment success or failure, as well as other factors that may influence the patient's progression through the treatments.

Here's a conceptual example of how you might set up the Markov model for this scenario:

Suppose there are three treatments: Surgery (S), Chemotherapy (C), and Radiation Therapy (R). Let's define the following health states and QALY values:

- Health State 1: "Pre-Treatment" (QALY: 1.0)
- Health State 2: "Post-Surgery" (QALY: 0.9)
- Health State 3: "Post-Chemotherapy" (QALY: 0.7)
- Health State 4: "Post-Radiation" (QALY: 0.8)
- Health State 5: "Remission" (QALY: 0.95)

Transitions between the health states can be probabilistic, representing the likelihood of successfully completing each treatment or experiencing a recurrence.

For example, the transition probabilities in the Markov model might be as follows:
- Pre-Treatment to Post-Surgery (S): 0.9 (90% success rate of surgery)
- Pre-Treatment to Post-Chemotherapy (C): 0.7 (70% success rate of chemotherapy)
- Pre-Treatment to Post-Radiation (R): 0.8 (80% success rate of radiation therapy)

After completing each treatment, the patient may have a chance of experiencing a recurrence (e.g., going back to Health State 1) or moving to the remission state (Health State 5).

The Markov model would simulate the patient's progression through these health states over time, calculating the overall expected QALY by considering the probabilities and QALY values associated with each state. This would provide insights into the potential outcomes of different treatment strategies and help in making decisions to maximize the patient's overall QALY.

Keep in mind that constructing and estimating the transition probabilities for such a Markov model can be challenging and often requires data from clinical studies, medical literature, or expert opinions. The model's accuracy and relevance depend on the quality of the data and the assumptions made in the modeling process. As with any predictive model, it's essential to interpret the results cautiously and in conjunction with expert medical knowledge and clinical judgment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>> I ASKED:
(can you construct the transition matrix and the current state matrix?)

>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:

Sure, let's construct the transition matrix and the initial state matrix for the Markov model in the cancer treatment decision problem. We will use the health states and transition probabilities mentioned earlier:

Health States:
- Health State 1: "Pre-Treatment" (QALY: 1.0)
- Health State 2: "Post-Surgery" (QALY: 0.9)
- Health State 3: "Post-Chemotherapy" (QALY: 0.7)
- Health State 4: "Post-Radiation" (QALY: 0.8)
- Health State 5: "Remission" (QALY: 0.95)

Transition Probabilities (based on the example):
- Pre-Treatment to Post-Surgery (S): 0.9 (90% success rate of surgery)
- Pre-Treatment to Post-Chemotherapy (C): 0.7 (70% success rate of chemotherapy)
- Pre-Treatment to Post-Radiation (R): 0.8 (80% success rate of radiation therapy)
- Post-Surgery to Remission: 0.8 (80% success rate of achieving remission after surgery)
- Post-Chemotherapy to Remission: 0.6 (60% success rate of achieving remission after chemotherapy)
- Post-Radiation to Remission: 0.7 (70% success rate of achieving remission after radiation therapy)

Let's create the transition matrix T and the initial state matrix S:

Transition Matrix T (5x5):
| T[1,1]  T[1,2]  T[1,3]  T[1,4]  T[1,5] |
| T[2,1]  T[2,2]  T[2,3]  T[2,4]  T[2,5] |
| T[3,1]  T[3,2]  T[3,3]  T[3,4]  T[3,5] |
| T[4,1]  T[4,2]  T[4,3]  T[4,4]  T[4,5] |
| T[5,1]  T[5,2]  T[5,3]  T[5,4]  T[5,5] |

We can fill in the transition matrix based on the transition probabilities:

T = | 0        0.9      0.7      0.8      0    |
    | 0        0        0        0        0.8  |
    | 0        0        0        0        0.6  |
    | 0        0        0        0        0.7  |
    | 0        0        0        0        0    |

The rows and columns of the transition matrix represent the different health states, and each element T[i, j] represents the probability of transitioning from health state i to health state j.

Next, let's create the initial state matrix S (5x1):

S = | S[1] |
    | S[2] |
    | S[3] |
    | S[4] |
    | S[5] |

The initial state matrix represents the probabilities of starting in each health state. For example, if the patient is in the "Pre-Treatment" state at the beginning, the initial state matrix would be:

S = | 1 |
    | 0 |
    | 0 |
    | 0 |
    | 0 |

This indicates that the patient has a 100% probability of starting in the "Pre-Treatment" state (Health State 1).

With the transition matrix T and the initial state matrix S, you can use the Markov model to simulate the patient's progression through different health states over time and calculate the overall expected QALY based on the probabilities and QALY values associated with each state.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>> I ASKED:
(calculate the 7th stage of progression and show?)


>>>> CHATGPT REPLIED:


To calculate the probabilities of being in each health state at the 7th stage of progression, we can use the transition matrix T and the initial state matrix S. We will apply the transition matrix repeatedly for 7 stages to simulate the patient's progression through different treatments.

To calculate the 7th stage, we can simply raise the transition matrix T to the power of 7 (T^7) and multiply it with the initial state matrix S.

Let's calculate the probabilities of being in each health state at the 7th stage:

Given Transition Matrix T (5x5):
| 0        0.9      0.7      0.8      0    |
| 0        0        0        0        0.8  |
| 0        0        0        0        0.6  |
| 0        0        0        0        0.7  |
| 0        0        0        0        0    |

Initial State Matrix S (5x1):
| S[1] |
| S[2] |
| S[3] |
| S[4] |
| S[5] |

Let's compute T^7 and then multiply it with S:

T^7 = T * T * T * T * T * T * T

After calculating T^7, we multiply it with the initial state matrix S to find the probabilities at the 7th stage.

Note: Since the transition probabilities are all 0 beyond the 7th stage, we can safely ignore the elements beyond the 7th stage in the calculation.

Here are the probabilities of being in each health state at the 7th stage:

| S[1] |
| S[2] |
| S[3] |
| S[4] |
| S[5] |

S[1] = 0
S[2] = 0
S[3] = 0
S[4] = 0
S[5] = 0

The probabilities are all 0 because the patient has transitioned through all possible states and has reached the "Remission" state (Health State 5) by the 7th stage of progression.

This result indicates that after undergoing several treatments, the patient is most likely to be in the "Remission" state (Health State 5) at the 7th stage of progression, which corresponds to a QALY value of 0.95 (as per the example).
